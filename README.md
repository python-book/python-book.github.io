## Dependencies
### CodeMirror
This is the code editer. It can be downloaded via https://github.com/codemirror/codemirror5 (use the get the ZIP file option to avoid downloading stuff from the internet during runtime)

### Pyodide
This is the Python run time. NOTE: pyodide needs a webserver, it does not work locally from file://
Download it from: https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/releases, extract it to pyodide dir (the default)
